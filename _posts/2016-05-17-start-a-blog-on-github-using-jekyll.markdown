Before I acutally write any blogs, I decide to record all the steps to set up this blog. It will be helpful for who wants to do this in the future (or even for myself if I want to start another blog).

OK. Without discussing why I chose Github plus jekyll as the blog platform, let's go ahead and create the blog.

Hosting with github pages
---
First of all, I am going to use github pages to host my blog. So if you don't know what is github pages and how it works, check out [this link][git-pages]. 

In short, github provide hosting service, one page as user page and one page per project.

- `{username}/{username}.github.io` is the repo for your user page at link https://username.github.io (although in my case I have the repo name in `winddweb.github.com` becasue I created it before github changed its domain to `.io`)
- `{username}/{repo-name}`'s `gh-pages` branch is the place for your project page at [https://username.github.io/repo-name]().

I will create my blog at a new repo named `blog`. So it will be [https://winddweb.github.io/blog](https://winddweb.github.io/blog)
